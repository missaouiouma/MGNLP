The corpus contains pairs of sentences \nextracted from news articles written in European Portuguese (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP), obtained from Google News Portugal \nand Brazil, respectively. To create the corpus, the authors started by collecting a set of news articles describing the \nsame event (one news article from Google News Portugal and another from Google News Brazil) from Google News. \nThen, they employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to retrieve pairs of similar sentences between sets of news \narticles that were grouped together around the same topic. For that, two LDA models were trained (for EP and for BP) \non external and large-scale collections of unannotated news articles from Portuguese and Brazilian news providers, respectively. \nThen, the authors defined a lower and upper threshold for the sentence similarity score of the retrieved pairs of sentences, \ntaking into account that high similarity scores correspond to sentences that contain almost the same content (paraphrase candidates), \nand low similarity scores correspond to sentences that are very different in content from each other (no-relation candidates).\nFrom the collection of pairs of sentences obtained at this stage, the authors performed some manual grammatical corrections \nand discarded some of the pairs wrongly retrieved. Furthermore, from a preliminary analysis made to the retrieved sentence pairs \nthe authors noticed that the number of contradictions retrieved during the previous stage was very low. Additionally, they also \nnoticed that event though paraphrases are not very frequent, they occur with some frequency in news articles. Consequently, \nin contrast with the majority of the currently available corpora for other languages, which consider as labels “neutral”, “entailment” \nand “contradiction” for the task of RTE, the authors of the ASSIN corpus decided to use as labels “none”, “entailment” and “paraphrase”.\nFinally, the manual annotation of pairs of sentences was performed by human annotators. At least four annotators were randomly \nselected to annotate each pair of sentences, which is done in two steps: (i) assigning a semantic similarity label (a score between 1 and 5, \nfrom unrelated to very similar); and (ii) providing an entailment label (one sentence entails the other, sentences are paraphrases, \nor no relation). Sentence pairs where at least three annotators do not agree on the entailment label were considered controversial \nand thus discarded from the gold standard annotations. The full dataset has 10,000 sentence pairs, half of which in Brazilian Portuguese \nand half in European Portuguese. Either language variant has 2,500 pairs for training, 500 for validation and 2,000 for testing.\n","url":"http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/assin/","license":"","givenLicense":"unknown","language":["pt"],"categories":["text-classification"],"tasks":["text-scoring","natural-language-inference","semantic-similarity-scoring"]}}

Each of these articles will have multiple questions, or 'prompts' associated with them. These prompts will ask about the relationship between an intervention and comparator with respect to an outcome, as reported in the trial. For example, a prompt may ask about the reported effects of aspirin as compared to placebo on the duration of headaches. For the sake of this task, we assume that a particular article will report that the intervention of interest either significantly increased, significantly decreased or had significant effect on the outcome, relative to the comparator.\n\nThe dataset could be used for automatic data extraction of the results of a given RCT.

{"id":"financial_phrasebank","data":{"description":"The key arguments for the low utilization of statistical techniques in\nfinancial sentiment analysis have been the difficulty of implementation for\npractical applications and the lack of high quality training data for building\nsuch models. Especially in the case of finance and economic texts, annotated\ncollections are a scarce resource and many are reserved for proprietary use\nonly. To resolve the missing training data problem, we present a collection of\n∼ 5000 sentences to establish human-annotated standards for benchmarking\nalternative modeling techniques.\n\nThe objective of the phrase level annotation task was to classify each example\nsentence into a positive, negative or neutral category by considering only the\ninformation explicitly available in the given sentence. Since the study is\nfocused only on financial and economic domains, the annotators were asked to\nconsider the sentences from the view point of an investor only; i.e. whether\nthe news may have positive, negative or neutral influence on the stock price.\nAs a result, sentences which have a sentiment that is not relevant from an\neconomic or financial perspective are considered neutral.\n\nThis release of the financial phrase bank covers a collection of 4840\nsentences. The selected collection of phrases was annotated by 16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets. Three of the annotators\nwere researchers and the remaining 13 annotators were master’s students at\nAalto University School of Business with majors primarily in finance,\naccounting, and economics.\n\nGiven the large number of overlapping annotations (5 to 8 annotations per\nsentence), there are several ways to define a majority vote based gold\nstandard. To provide an objective comparison, we have formed 4 alternative\nreference datasets based on the strength of majority agreement: all annotators\nagree, >=75% of annotators agree, >=66% of annotators agree and >=50% of\nannotators agree.\n","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/ankurzing/sentiment-analysis-for-financial-news","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License","givenLicense":"cc-by-nc-sa-3.0","language":["en"],"categories":["text-classification"],"tasks":["multi-class-classification","sentiment-classification"]}}

{"id":"hind_encorp","data":{"description":"HindEnCorp parallel texts (sentence-aligned) come from the following sources:\nTides, which contains 50K sentence pairs taken mainly from news articles. This dataset was originally col- lected for the DARPA-TIDES surprise-language con- test in 2002, later refined at IIIT Hyderabad and provided for the NLP Tools Contest at ICON 2008 (Venkatapathy, 2008).\n\nCommentaries by Daniel Pipes contain 322 articles in English written by a journalist Daniel Pipes and translated into Hindi.\n\nEMILLE. This corpus (Baker et al., 2002) consists of three components: monolingual, parallel and annotated corpora. There are fourteen monolingual sub- corpora, including both written and (for some lan- guages) spoken data for fourteen South Asian lan- guages. The EMILLE monolingual corpora contain in total 92,799,000 words (including 2,627,000 words of transcribed spoken data for Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu). The parallel corpus consists of 200,000 words of text in English and its accompanying translations into Hindi and other languages.\n\nSmaller datasets as collected by Bojar et al. (2010) include the corpus used at ACL 2005 (a subcorpus of EMILLE), a corpus of named entities from Wikipedia (crawled in 2009), and Agriculture domain parallel corpus.\n￼\nFor the current release, we are extending the parallel corpus using these sources:\nIntercorp (Čermák and Rosen,2012) is a large multilingual parallel corpus of 32 languages including Hindi. The central language used for alignment is Czech. Intercorp’s core texts amount to 202 million words. These core texts are most suitable for us because their sentence alignment is manually checked and therefore very reliable. They cover predominately short sto- ries and novels. There are seven Hindi texts in Inter- corp. Unfortunately, only for three of them the English translation is available; the other four are aligned only with Czech texts. The Hindi subcorpus of Intercorp contains 118,000 words in Hindi.\n\nTED talks 3 held in various languages, primarily English, are equipped with transcripts and these are translated into 102 languages. There are 179 talks for which Hindi translation is available.\n\nThe Indic multi-parallel corpus (Birch et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012) is a corpus of texts from Wikipedia translated from the respective Indian language into English by non-expert translators hired over Mechanical Turk. The quality is thus somewhat mixed in many respects starting from typesetting and punctuation over capi- talization, spelling, word choice to sentence structure. A little bit of control could be in principle obtained from the fact that every input sentence was translated 4 times. We used the 2012 release of the corpus.\n\nLaunchpad.net is a software collaboration platform that hosts many open-source projects and facilitates also collaborative localization of the tools. We downloaded all revisions of all the hosted projects and extracted the localization (.po) files.\n\nOther smaller datasets. This time, we added Wikipedia entities as crawled in 2013 (including any morphological variants of the named entitity that appears on the Hindi variant of the Wikipedia page) and words, word examples and quotes from the Shabdkosh online dictionary.\n","url":"https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-625F-0","license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0","givenLicense":"cc-by-nc-sa-3.0","language":["en","hi"],"categories":["translation"],"tasks":[]}}

Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its completion, ImageNet hopes to offer tens of millions of cleanly sorted images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy. ImageNet 2012 is the most commonly used subset of ImageNet.

It contains a wide\n    variety of tasks and covers 11 major Indian languages - as, bn, gu, hi, kn, ml, mr, or, pa, ta, te.\n\n\nThe Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque et al., 2011) is a reading comprehension task\nin which a system must read a sentence with a pronoun and select the referent of that pronoun from\na list of choices. The examples are manually constructed to foil simple statistical methods: Each\none is contingent on contextual information provided by a single word or phrase in the sentence.\nTo convert the problem into sentence pair classification, we construct sentence pairs by replacing\nthe ambiguous pronoun with each possible referent. The task is to predict if the sentence with the\npronoun substituted is entailed by the original sentence. We use a small evaluation set consisting of\nnew examples derived from fiction books that was shared privately by the authors of the original\ncorpus. While the included training set is balanced between two classes, the test set is imbalanced\nbetween them (65% not entailment). Also, due to a data quirk, the development set is adversarial:\nhypotheses are sometimes shared between training and development examples, so if a model memorizes the\ntraining examples, they will predict the wrong label on corresponding development set\nexample. As with QNLI, each example is evaluated separately, so there is not a systematic correspondence\nbetween a model's score on this task and its score on the unconverted original task. We\ncall converted dataset WNLI (Winograd NLI).

The only processing of the text that has been applied is the removal of boilerplate license text, and the mapping of offensive discriminatory words as specified by Ofcom to placeholder tokens. Users are free to model the data at the character-level, subword-level, or via any mechanism that can model an arbitrary string of text.\nTo compare models we propose to continue measuring the word-level perplexity, by calculating the total likelihood of the dataset (via any chosen subword vocabulary or character-based scheme) divided by the number of tokens --- specified below in the dataset statistics table.\nOne could use this dataset for benchmarking long-range language models, or use it to pre-train for other natural language processing tasks which require long-range reasoning, such as LAMBADA or NarrativeQA. We would not recommend using this dataset to train a general-purpose language model, e.g. for applications to a production-system dialogue agent, due to the dated linguistic style of old texts and the inherent biases present in historical writing.\n","url":"https://github.com/deepmind/pg19","license":"","givenLicense":"","language":["en"],"categories":[],"tasks":[]}}

All dialogs in this release were created using a Wizard of Oz (WOz) methodology in which crowdsourced workers played the role of a 'user' and trained call center operators played the role of the 'assistant'. In this way, users were led to believe they were interacting with an automated system that “spoke” using text-to-speech (TTS) even though it was in fact a human behind the scenes. As a result, users could express themselves however they chose in the context of an automated interface.\n","url":"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Taskmaster/tree/master/TM-2-2020","license":"","givenLicense":"cc-by-4.0","language":["en"],"categories":["text-generation","fill-mask"],"tasks":["dialogue-modeling"]}}
